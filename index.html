						<h2>WELCOME</h2>	
						
					</header>
							<p>I am Sidardth, data analyst and social researcher passionate about working with organisations that want to make effective use of their data.</p>
					
							<p>Since I was young, I have always enjoyed solving puzzles. 
								
								So thatâ€™s how I look at big data sets: to me it is one big puzzle I want to solve.
								
								Finding patterns nobody else sees is the challenge to me.</p>


						<p></p>
						My favourite part is exploring data with finding trends and anomalies that no on else can see, at last present findings in an appealing way.

							<h2>What Motivates Me?</h2>
							<p>Well, for me the answer is very simple, I like finding creative solutions
								to the puzzles, and to overcome my challenges. Graduating with a Bachelor`s degree few years back,
								I had no idea, in which field should i step into, and anything that involved coding was automatically off the list.
								Seeing a line of code or syntax made me overwhelmed and anxious leading me to believe this is not for me.
							<space></space>	After some guidence and alot of self-motivation[alot] I learned day by day, bit by bit, comprehended and implemended  what I learned 
								into projects and eventually climbed my way to a point where I can contribute and present something valuable and unique to 
								a company. At last I can say I  was happy to take on challanges like SQL, R, Power BI, Tableau and conque them.
							I look forward to many new challanges ahead and make great connection and acquaintance through the journey.</p>

							<p>A little secrct, I made this webpage with my portfolio webpage as a personal challange without any prior coding knowledge In Html5 and webpage development.</p>
